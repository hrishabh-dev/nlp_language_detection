# NLP Language Detection Model

## Overview
This project implements an NLP language detection model that achieves an accuracy of 95% using the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm. The model can accurately identify and classify text into several languages based on its content.

## Requirements
To run the Jupyter Notebook, you'll need the following packages:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install jupyter scikit-learn pandas numpy
```

## Using the Notebook
1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/language-detection-model.git
   cd language-detection-model
   ```

2. **Open the Jupyter Notebook**: Launch Jupyter Notebook from the command line:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. **Run the Notebook**: Open the `language_detection_model.ipynb` file and follow the instructions within the notebook to run the model and perform language detection.

## Model Details
### Algorithm Used: Multinomial Naive Bayes
I chose the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm for this project due to the following reasons:

1. **Simplicity and Efficiency**: It's a straightforward implementation and performs quick computations, making it ideal for text classification tasks.

2. **Suitability for Text Data**: The model leverages the frequency of word occurrences (token counts), which works well for language detection.

3. **Performance**: The model achieved an accuracy of 95% on the test dataset, highlighting its effectiveness in distinguishing between different languages.

## Results
The Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier demonstrated robust performance on a dataset of various languages, achieving an overall accuracy of 95%. 

- Accuracy may vary among languages; please refer to the detailed results in the notebook.

## Conclusion
This language detection model successfully demonstrates the effectiveness of the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm in classifying text. Future improvements may involve exploring more advanced models or feature engineering techniques to enhance its performance.
